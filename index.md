## Projects 
Project 1: Vulnerability Assessment Using Burp Suite on a Home Lab with Active Directory  [Link to Project 1](./Project1.html)
> Conducted a thorough vulnerability assessment on a home lab environment configured with Active Directory, using Burp Suite to identify and analyze web application vulnerabilities. Set up a virtualized lab with Active Directory and a vulnerable web application to simulate a corporate network. Employed Burp Suiteâ€™s Spider and Scanner tools to detect security issues such as SQL injection and XSS. Performed manual testing to validate findings and explored impacts on Active Directory integration. Delivered a detailed report with actionable remediation recommendations, enhancing the overall security posture of the simulated environment.
